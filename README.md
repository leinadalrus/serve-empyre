# Empyre
 Programming something akin to ALBERT to make a Domain-specific Language for my self-learning of Philology and Linguistics.

 This will also serve as a Natural Language Processing server for my web-app, but needs an interpreter to specifically target non-stopword-specific library/vocabulary.
